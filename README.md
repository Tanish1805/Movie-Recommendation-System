# Movie-Recommendation-System
Built a recommendation engine using content based and collaborative filter.

1. Scrapped data of 6000+ movies from wikipedia and TMBD website using Api key and preprocessed it using pandas.
2. Created a collaborative filter for movie recommendation using a dataset containing around 2.5 crore ratings given by
1.6 lakhs+ users for around 59,000 movies.
3. Also created a content based movie recommendation system using TfidfVectorizer and Cosine similarity.
4. The model can be found in finalmodel.ipynb, other ipynb files are just the preprocessing done on the data
